    shelf floor: "Give the segmentatioc /n masks for shelf. Output a JSON list of segmentation masks where each entry contains the 2D bounding box in the key \"box_2d\", the segmentation mask in key \"mask\", and the text label in the key \"label\". Use descriptive labels."  
    shelf: "I will now provide an image of a shelf (cabinet) taken at close range, where the entire shelf may not be visible. Please ignore any open doors and generate segmentation masks for the shelf body and all objects inside it as a single, unified mask. You must include every area that could possibly be part of the shelf—even minimally—in that one mask. Output a JSON list where each entry contains a 2D bounding box (box_2d), the combined segmentation mask (mask), and a descriptive text label (label)."
    test: "I will now provide an image that includes a shelf taken from a close distance, where the entire shelf may not be visible; please generate segmentation masks for the shelf (cabinet) only, ignoring open doors, and mask all non-shelf areas in solid black, outputting a JSON list where each entry includes the 2D bounding box (box_2d), the segmentation mask (mask), and a descriptive text label (label)."
